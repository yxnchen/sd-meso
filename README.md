# MESO: A Multi-Participant Spatio-Temporal Event Stream Dataset in Operating Room from Two Tertiary Hospitals in China

This repository contains the data processing pipeline and analysis code for *MESO: A Multi-Participant Spatio-Temporal Event Stream Dataset in Operating Rooms from Two Tertiary Hospitals in China
(in submission)*.



## Environment Setup

This study employs Python for computational reproducibility. To replicate the analysis, execute the following steps:

```bash
# Create a conda virtual environment with Python 3.11
conda create -n meso python=3.11

# Activate the created environment
conda activate meso

# Install the necessary dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Folder Structure

Prior to conducting the analysis, users must download the dataset from the designated [figshare]() repository. The downloaded data files should be placed in the project's `data` folder, resulting in the following directory structure:

```
data/
├── meso-sah-event-2023.json
├── meso-sah-event-2023.pkl
├── meso-sah-metadata-2023.csv
├── meso-xph-event-2023.json   
├── meso-xph-event-2023.pkl     
├── meso-xph-metadata-2023.csv 
├── sample-physiology-waveform-Hr.csv
└── sample-physiology-waveform-SpO2.csv

├── MESO_validate.ipynb
└── event_extract_from_phy.ipynb

├── meso-duration-distribution.pdf     
├── meso-heatmap-start-end-time.pdf    
├── meso-inter-event-time-ccdf.pdf

├── meso-room-diversity-boxplot.pdf
├── meso-shap-importance.pdf
├── meso-starttime-distribution.pdf
└── meso-surgeries-per-day.pdf 
```


## Analysis Reproduction

Following data acquisition and environment configuration, execute the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce all analytical results and figures presented in the paper:

- `event_extract_from_phy.ipynb`: It will use the sample physiology waveform data in the `data` folder.
- `MESO_validate.ipynb`: It will use the publish MESO data files.
